## Important Points
* I have used here Github for end-to-endÂ solutions. GitHub actions and Github pages are really helpful here.

## Approach to solution
* Initially, I kept the problem statement very small, just fetching the data from uri and inserting it in html. I tried it on my local system.
* After this, I approached the Unit test part. It was most difficult for me as I dont have much experience with TDD. 
* After finishing the basic code and test part, I jumped over the Github actions and Github pages. It was the easiest part for me as I have experience with CI/CD tools and other cloud-native tools.
* Following URLs helped me in this journey :)
